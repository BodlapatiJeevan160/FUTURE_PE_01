INTRO:
Hey everyone! Welcome back to the channel. Today we’re talking about something extremely important for every student — saving money in 2026. With rising food prices, transport costs, and education fees, managing money is harder than ever. So here are 10 simple and powerful ways to save money as a student.

---

1. Track Your Spending
Use apps like Walnut, Spendee, or Money Manager. These apps automatically track your UPI and card transactions. The moment you understand where your money goes, you naturally reduce unnecessary spending.

---

2. Avoid Daily Micro-Spending
Small daily purchases add up to thousands each month.
Examples:
- Tea/coffee daily
- Snacks after college
- Autos for short distances  
Cutting these can save ₹2,000–₹4,000 per month easily.

---

3. Use Student Discounts
In 2026, many platforms offer student discounts:
- Spotify Student → 50% off
- YouTube Premium → 40% off
- Notion Pro → Free
- GitHub Student Pack → Free premium tools  
Always check for a student plan before subscribing.

4. Cook Instead of Ordering
Ordering food is 3x more expensive than cooking at home. Even cooking 3 times a week can save you ₹3,000–₹5,000 per month.

---

5. Buy Used Instead of New
You can buy second-hand:
- Textbooks
- Laptops (refurbished)
- Calculators
- College supplies  
Safe options: OLX, Cashify, Amazon Refurbished, seniors in college.

---

6. Use Public Transport or Carpool
Buses, shared autos, or metro passes are far cheaper than Uber/auto rides. Carpooling with friends is another big money saver.

---

7. Start a Side Income
Small earnings make a big difference. Options:
- Content writing
- Editing reels or videos
- Freelancing
- Teaching juniors
- Selling notes  
Even earning ₹3000 monthly gives huge financial relief.

---

8. Use the 50-30-20 Rule
A simple budgeting rule:
- 50% needs
- 30% wants
- 20% savings  
This keeps your financial life stable and controlled.

---

9. Set a Monthly Spending Limit
Before the month begins, decide your maximum spending limit. This prevents impulse spending and keeps you disciplined.

---

10. Start an Emergency Fund
Saving even ₹20/day = ₹600/month = ₹7200/year.  
This fund helps during unexpected college expenses, medical needs, or travel.
